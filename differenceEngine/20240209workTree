'Topic20240209':maxwell equation on compute shaders


in the PDF essay[1] we know that the maxwell equation is only depends on the 'Faraday's law' and the 'Amp√®re's law' with respect to the time update.
this is also suggested in the[2] which applied a web electromagnetism simulation and in a git repository

i derive the exact update from the two formula mensioned above
