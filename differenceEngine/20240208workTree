'Topic20240208':compute shaders

the plan is as follows
the physics engine will be used is the difference maxwell engine the tech from[1]
this will use several tech
1.compute shader in GLSL
2.maxwell simulation run on the compute shader
3.interact to this new physics world

the game control is use pygame
1.know the document[2] and read it
2.follow the certain tutorial[3] through out


the file
'main_shader.py' is a copied and modified version of the YouTube turtorial[4]
'main' is a unfinished version of the retype version of the YouTube turtorial[4]
in this file i realized the general compute shader and make the 'conways game of life' with it.

the file
'test.py' is a copied version of the code on[5]
this is a example of to only use moderngl and moderngl_window to open window without pygame and take control only use these two CG library
